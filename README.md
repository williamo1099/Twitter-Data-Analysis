# Twitter Data Analysis

Analyzing a Twitter dataset consisting of Tweet objects using MapReduce. A Tweet object is an object encoded in JSON representing a Tweet from a user and has a series of attributes (see more details [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/data-dictionary/overview)). Here is the list of analyses done using these MapReduce codes.

* Analysis on average tweet length in one hour per month.
* Analysis on average tweet length in one day per month.
* Analysis on top 20 most active Twitter users.
* Analysis on top 10 most retweeted tweets.
* Analysis on tweet partition.
